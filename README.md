# RandomizedLS
A place to prototype (and plan) randomized least squares solvers for BALLISTIC
- 21.06.21
  -  Plot the error metric graphs with multiple number seeds.Done.
  -  Implement the algorithm that runs in single precision, which targets the user who does not care too much about the precision.
  -  Test with matrices with different coherence(use new dataset, not only the test generator function).
- 21.06.28
  -  Figure out why the Blendenpik has abnormal behavior when the condition number goes to 1e16.Done.
- 21.07.05(Independece Day Vacation)
- 21.07.12
  -  Implement Blendenpik that runs in single precision.
  -  Seperate LSRN into several phases and count flops and running time of each phase.
  -  Test with matrices with different singular value distributions.
