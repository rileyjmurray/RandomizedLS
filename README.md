- 21.06.21
  -  Plot the error metric graphs with multiple number seeds.
  -  Implement the algorithm that runs in single precision, which targets the user who does not care too much about the precision.
  -  Test with matrices with different coherence(use new dataset, not only the test generator function).
- 21.06.28
  -  Figure out why the Blendenpik has abnormal behavior when the condition number goes to 1e16.
