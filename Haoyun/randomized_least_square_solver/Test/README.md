Instructions:
    The funny plots are generated by the large tests in the test folder.
    large_test_matrix_size_cond is to generate the heatmap and 2D plots related to the parameters matrix size and condition number.
    large_test_theta_cond is to generate the heatmap and 2D plots related to the parameters theta between b vectors and condition number.
    Riley_Blen_Scipy_LSQR is to modify your blendenpik to use scipy lsqr.
